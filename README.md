# tictactoe
A tic tac toe game.


Instructions:
-----------------------------------
1. Download the files
2. Open standalone.html on a local server in your browser
3. Play tic tac toe

Roadmap
-----------------------------------
1. Sleeker design. I could implement this by incorporating into the CSS some starter code to make it look and feel nicer. I could probably get the necessary components somewhere like Bootstrap.

2. Reset button. I'm not entirely certain how to go about implementing a reset button, but I'm sure there's a guide somewhere out there that eludes me.
